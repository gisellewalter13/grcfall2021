        <p class="ab_p">After a career in Accounting, Giselle grew tired of the corporate world and wanted to fulfill her dream of opening a ceramics studio. She started making pottery in high school and fell in love with the artform. <br> Whether you are a new to the craft and are taking classes, or you are a experienced potter using the studio pass to continue your self study of ceramics, she hopes all feel welcome to be creative.  </p>
